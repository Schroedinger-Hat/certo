# Code of Conduct

This project follows a standard code of conduct to ensure an open and welcoming environment for all contributors.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

## Expected Behavior

- Be respectful and considerate in all interactions.
- Use welcoming and inclusive language.
- Be open to constructive feedback and to helping others learn.
- Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include: harassing or discriminatory comments, deliberate intimidation, personal attacks, sustained disruption of discussions, or any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces (including issues, pull requests, discussions, chat channels) and to events organized by the project.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to the project maintainers. If possible, include:

- A description of the incident
- Names (if known)
- Screenshots, logs, or links to the relevant content

Open an issue labeled `code-of-conduct` (private if preferred) or contact the maintainers directly via the repository's contact channel. If you would like the report to remain confidential, indicate that clearly.

## Enforcement

Maintainers will review reports and take appropriate and proportional actions, which may include a warning, temporary or permanent ban from the repository, or other measures. Decisions may be communicated to the reporting party and (when appropriate) to the community.

## Attribution

This document is intended as a short, approachable Code of Conduct for contributors. Projects are encouraged to adopt a fuller policy (for example the Contributor Covenant) if they need more detailed guidance.

If you want, I can add a link to the Contributor Covenant or expand this file with enforcement contact details. Let me know your preferred contact email or process.
